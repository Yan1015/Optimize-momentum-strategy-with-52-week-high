# Optimize-momentum-strategy-with-52-week-high
## Introduction
This project aims to optimize momentum trading strategy with 52-week high. As we all know that momentum strategy means 
stock turns exhibit momentum behavior at intermediate horizons. Selling losers and buying winners can help us make profits. 
However, there two problems, one is what kind of past returns can best describe the future returns, past daily return, past monthly returns or other? The other one is that long-term reversal will occur after the momentum.

So in this project a optimization is made for momentum strategy. We developed a series of new momentum trading strategies based on the ratio of the current stock price to each of five different reference points in past prices: 52-week high, 52-week median, 52-week
low, half-year high, and 2-year high and then measure their performance. Finally, 52-week high price strategy results in stronger
investment performance than several others.
